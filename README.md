This extension's goal is to fix the change Reddit introduced to the comment system.

This will just delete the unnecessary and cluttery boxes introduced.
Example of cluttery boxes introduced can be seen here: http://i.imgur.com/ijoGygo.jpg

This extension will delete the 'More Comments' button, 'More from X SUBREDDIT' section, and all posts beloning to said section.
It will return Reddit to the glorious clean comment format it was before.
